Private businesses don’t do this work because it doesn’t turn a profit. But there’s plenty of work to do and people willing to do it. The government could match workers to jobs and provide training if necessary. The money could be controlled by local communities. Cities and towns could decide on their needs, propose projects, and receive federal money that would then be distributed by local organizations.
