  nowWhat: `
    We do not have much more information about how long the dispute process takes because online dispute tools have not been used before. By making the dispute form easier to fill out, we are helping more people dispute their debts. This is a good thing! But it could affect the time that it takes for the Department to review each case. If you don't hear a response in a timely manner, this may be cause for legal action. We are watching what happens to these disputes very closely. And will we will prompt you to let us know what happens in your case so we can work together to develop collective strategies to fight back.
    <br><br>
    We will mail your dispute to the appropriate agency as soon as possible.
