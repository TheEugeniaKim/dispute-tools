            p.pb2.-fw-500 For decades we have been forced to debt finance basic needs as the cost of living has skyrocketed and wages have flatlined. While we have struggled to keep food on the table and care for our families our wages have been garnished, our tax returns seized, and our credit destroyed.

            h4.pb3 As a member of The Debt Collective, you might dispute your debt because:
            ul.pl0.ml2.-fw-500
              li You were defrauded by your school.
              li You were trapped by a predatory lender.
              li You are being harassed by a debt collector.
              li You borrowed for healthcare, education, or other basic necessities.
              li You can’t afford to pay your debt.
              li You are disputing your debt as an act of economic solidarity with other people.
              li You took out Parent Plus loans to help your child pay for college.
